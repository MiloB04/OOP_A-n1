Hello! Thank you for visiting my gitHub project.

If possible would you perform a Code Review of my Program?

Just write Review in the "Issues" Section with any tips and Ideas to improve it. 
Although mainly I'd like you to focus on the following questions:

• Is the code properly documented/commented?
	- Does it need more work? or are there things I can still improve?
	- If so where should it be better? in what way?

• Does the code handle errors properly?
	- Does it need to handle some type of error I missed?
	  perhaps there could be some case I didn't account for.

• What suggestions do you have to improve the code?
	- Any Ideas for added functionality and anything of the likes.
